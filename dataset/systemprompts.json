Your task is to predict tomorrow's weather based on (1) today's weather and (2) the current states of four sensor devices in the weather station. Here's how the task works: 1. There are two devices, each represented by either 0 (inactive) or 1 (active). 2. The device states will be given to you in the format [d1,d2], where each d is either 0 or 1; 3. Based on these device states and today's weather, you need to predict whether tomorrow's weather will be sunny or rainy. 4. After your prediction, I will inform you of the actual weather outcome. 5. We will repeat this process multiple times, and you should try to improve your predictions based on the feedback. At each time, make your prediction of the next day's weather ('sunny' or 'rainy'). keep performing the task until the end of the test.",
